# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Chat monitor now supports a PrefixMask-style review filter file (`ChatReviewMask.txt`), configured by `[ChatMonitor] ReviewMaskFile` in `settings.ini`.
- Main form now includes a `Play chat notification sounds` checkbox that toggles chat sounds at runtime and persists to `[ChatMonitor] SoundEnabled`.

### Changed
- Chat app selection now comes only from `ChatReviewMask.txt`; legacy `[ChatMonitor.Rules]` matching is no longer used.
- Unread detection now uses a fixed caption counter pattern `(\d+)`.
- GUI refresh activation bursts are now deduplicated to avoid back-to-back full redraws.
- Scripts/Desktop/ShortCuts refresh now runs through background snapshot workers, with only final UI assignment on the main thread.
- Mask and pattern parsing now uses cache-backed snapshots (`MaxLogic.Cache` + file dependencies) to avoid reparsing unchanged files.
- Chat monitor processing now runs asynchronously with overlap guards, uses shared app snapshots, and prefetches expensive metadata in parallel.
- Chat unread detection hot path now uses a lightweight caption parser instead of regex matching per app.
